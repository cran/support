Description: Provides the function sp() for generating the support points proposed in Mak and Joseph (2017)
    <arXiv:1609.01811>. Support points are representative points of a possibly non-uniform 
    distribution, and can be used as optimal sampling or integration points for a distribution of choice. The provided
    function sp() can be used to generate support points for standard distributions or for reducing big data
    (e.g., from Markov-chain Monte Carlo methods). A detailed description of the algorithm is found in Mak and Joseph (2017).
